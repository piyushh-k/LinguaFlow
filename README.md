# LinguaFlow

🚧 **This project is currently under active development. Features and UI may change.** 🚧

LinguaFlow is a web app that lets you **convert voice messages or audio files into text and translate that text into any language you want**.  
You can upload an audio file (or record your voice directly in English), get an instant transcription, and then translate the result to your chosen language—all in your browser.
